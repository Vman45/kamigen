                    p The comics page has become a bit crowded so I've reorganised the sub pages into issues. Issue 01 is complete, Issue 02 has 6 pages to go before its done.
                    p The game demo scenes on the homepage and game page have been updated with new cloud effects. The next step will be adding man made landmarks and structures on and around the island.
