                    p Introducing the Umang swarm and their master - Ang Mata. These infosheets are a critical part of the writing process. It's been more challenging than expected to shift the setting back to pre-history.
                    p There are other character sheets but I'm holding off sharing them until their phase of the story is executed as it contains spoilers. For those really keen, you can find them on Github.
