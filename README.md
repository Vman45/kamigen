# Story and setting
The lore is currently being fleshed out by the comics which also serves to generate artwork and build an audience for all Kamigen media.

[Camiguin Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camiguin) in the Philippines is the inspiration for Kamigen Island. Aspects of Filipino, Mindanao and Visayan culture are referenced for Kamigen new art and ideas.

The in-game island is generated from a [height map of the actual Camiguin island](./assets/height.png), with some tweaks.

[Traditional Baybayin script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baybayin) (known as Badlit in the Visayas) will be a native peoples language in the Kamigen story as a tribute to indigenous peoples of all lands who were disaffected by colonisation
  - The official website footer link to home currently has "Kamigen" written in Badlit instead of the official logo font
